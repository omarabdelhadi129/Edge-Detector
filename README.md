Canny Edge Detector 
This repository contains an implementation of the Canny Edge Detection algorithm, a popular technique used in image processing to detect edges in images. The implementation includes various steps such as Gaussian blurring, gradient calculation, non-maximum suppression, double thresholding, and edge tracking by hysteresis. The notebook demonstrates the application of the algorithm on different images and visualizes the results. The results are all inside the ipynb file, as long as diffrent trials with diffrent sigmas and thresholds used.

Install the required dependencies using pip:


    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Ensure you have OpenCV installed (`cv2`).

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook `canny_edge_detection.ipynb` in your Jupyter environment.
2. Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to execute the Canny edge detection algorithm with stick filters.
3. Modify the notebook as needed for your specific use case.
